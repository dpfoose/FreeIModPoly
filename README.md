A free software implementation of the "Vancouver Raman Algorithm" for MATLAB/Octave, R, and the Armadillo C++ library

The "Vancouver Raman Algorithm" is available from the original authors only in the form of a Windows executable, shipped with a version of the .NET redistributable which may not be compatible with modern Windows versions. This clean-room implementation based on the original published article (http://dx.doi.org/10.1366/000370207782597003) allows the algorithm to be used by researchers using R, Octave, MATLAB or the Armadillo C++ library. While code is subject to copyright, algorithms themselves are not.

Also see Edgar Guevara's MATLAB implementation of the algorithm here: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/60383-guevaracodina-vancouver
